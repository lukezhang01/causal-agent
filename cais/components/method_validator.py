You are evaluating an Instrumental Variables (IV / 2SLS) design.

Weak-IV flag (F < 10): {weak_iv_flag}

=== IV ASSUMPTIONS ===
- Relevance: This assumption states that the instrument is correlated with treatment, i.e., the instrument affects treatment.
  We can check this assumption using the first-stage F-statistic, i.e., from the regression of treatment on instrument.
- Exclusion Restriction: This is an untestable assumption, which states that the instrument affects the outcome only through the treatment.
  We typically justify this assumption using domain knowledge.
- Independence: This is again an untestable assumption that requires design/domain justification.
  It states that the instrument is not related to unobserved confounders affecting the outcome and treatment.
  If the data comes from a randomized encouragement design, this assumption is easily argued. Otherwise,
  we must justify using domain knowledge or argue the instrument is "as-good-as-random" conditional on the control variables.
- Monotonicity: This is untestable and usually argued by design. Moreover, this assumption is more relevant for LATE interpretation of IV, where
  we assume there are no defiers (people who would do the opposite of the treatment assignment).

=== YOUR TASK ===
1) Critically assess the statistical evidence for Relevance as given.
2) Critically assess whether the untestable assumptions (Exclusion, Independence, Monotonicity (for LATE framework)) are plausible in general terms.
3) If all assumptions are plausible, i.e.,
   a. Selected instrument is relevant
   b. Exclusion restriction is justified in this setting
   c. Independence is justified in this setting
   d. Monotonicity is justified in this setting (if LATE interpretation is desired)

=== PSM ASSUMPTION ===
- Conditional Ignorability: This is an untestable assumption. We justify its plausibility by arguing that we have measured all confounders affecting both treatment and outcome. 
                            This means you need to check that there are no unmeasured confounders affecting both treatment and outcome.
- Positivity: This assumption states that every unit has a positive probability of receiving treatment given the confounders.
              We can partially check this by looking at the propensity score distributions.

1) Critically assess the statistical evidence above (SMDs, PS overlap).

Data Description: {data_description}

Note that the treatment variable indicates whether an observation is treated or not. Note that DiD has two cases:
1) Staggered adoption: Different groups get treated at different times. In this case, treatment indicates whether a group (also called unit)
is treated at a given time or not.
2) Canonical DiD: All groups get treated at the same time. In this case, treatment indicates whether a group is in the treated group or not.

- Post-periods: {post_periods}
- Pretrend test p-value: {pretrend_pval}
- Pretrend slope difference: {pretrend_slope_diff}

=== DiD ASSUMPTIONS ===
- Parallel Trends: This assumption states that the treatment and control groups would have followed similar trends over time in the absence of treatment.
 We can test this partially. Usually, we plot the outcomes over time to visually inspect the presence of parallel trends.
 However, in case we do not have data for multiple pre-periods, we cannot test this. Instead, we need to justify this assumption using domain knowledge.
- No Anticipatory Effects: This assumption states that the treatment effects do not occur before the treatment is actually implemented.
 This is usually argued by design.

=== YOUR TASK ===
1) Critically assess the statistical evidence above.
2) Focus on determining whether parallel trends and no anticipation assumptions are plausible in this setting.
3) Also check if the correct set of variables has been selected. For instance, the time variable should give information about treatment timing.
 It cannot be a time-related variable that is not related to treatment timing.
