The data come from a household survey conducted across 686 households in 120 habitations in Uttar Pradesh, India. According to state regulations, households must be located within 40 meters of a power pole to be eligible for a legal electricity connection. Using this rule, the study sampled households situated 20–35 meters from the nearest pole, which were eligible to get electricity from the given pole, and 45–60 meters from the pole, those that were ineligible. Houses in the 35–45 meter range are excluded to minimize measurement error. The survey targeted areas with a balanced mix of electrified and non-electrified households and collected detailed information on household demographics, expenditures, appliance ownership and use, and daily activities.\xa0\n\nThe variables are\nfood_expenditure: total monthly household expenditure on food in rupees\neducation_expenditure: total monthly household expenditure on education in rupees\nkerosene_expenditure: total monthly household expenditure on kerosene in rupees\ntotal_expenditure: total monthly household expenditure in rupees\nage: age of the head of the household\xa0\nreligion: 1= Hindu, 0=otherwise\xa0\ndistance: distance of the household from the electric grid\ntreat: 1 if the household is connected to the grid, 0 if not connected to the grid\nforcing: 1 if the household is eligible to get connected to the grid (within 40 meters), 0 if the household is not eligible to get connected to the grid\nkerosene_lamps: 1 = household has kerosene lamp, 0 = no kerosene lamp\nnum_kerosene_lamps: number of kerosene wick lamps and lanterns owned by the household\nkerosene_lamp_hours: number of hours kerosene lamps are used daily\nkerosene_other: liters of kerosene used for other household purposes\nlighting_hours: total daily hours of household light usage\nchild_lighting: daily hours of lighting used by children for reading and studying\nadult_lighting: daily hours of lighting used by adults for reading and studying\nchild_activity: number of hours children spend at home in a given day\nadult_activity: number of hours adults spend at home in a given day\nappliances: number of appliances owned by the household\nappliance_use: number of daily hours using appliances by the household\nsatisfaction_reliability: satisfaction with the reliability of lighting\nsatisfaction_cost: satisfaction with the cost of lighting\nsatisfaction_safety: satisfaction with the safety of lighting\nsatisfaction_brightness: satisfaction with the brightness of lighting\nsatisfaction: overall satisfaction with lighting\nsatisfaction_chng: change in satisfaction with lighting over the past five years\nelec_value: willingness to pay for adequate electricity\nincome_increase: belief that electrification will increase household income\nbusiness_interest: interest in starting a new business due to electrification\nsatisfaction_business: belief that electrification supports business aspirations\naspirations: mean value of five questions measuring general aspirations\nknowledge: battery of questions related to knowledge of politics and popular culture"
